DAS - Data Access Services

Service Data Object(SDO) provides a uniform API for handling different types of data. Data Access Service (DAS) 
simplifies handling of data when interacting with the back-end data source and frees application developers 
from dealing with tedious and error-prone transformation between end source types and SDO Data Object Types/properties..
