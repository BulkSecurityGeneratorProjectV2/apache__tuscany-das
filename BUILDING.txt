Building DAS


1. Set up your environment using the instructions for building the whole of Tuscany (http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/java-projects.html),
but only download and install Java 5, Maven and Svn

2. Make sure 'mvn' and 'svn' commands are in your PATH environment variable.

3. Check out the DAS open source projects from Apache.

      Commands:

      md <local tuscany dir>
      cd <local tuscany dir>
      md java
      cd java
      svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/tuscany/java/das das
      cd das
      svn up das

4.Run "mvn" under <local tuscany dir>/java/das directory to install POM files from the root project to the local repository


      Commands:

      cd <local tuscany dir>/java/das
      mvn

      Notes:
         1.If the mvn command completed successfully, you will see BUILD SUCCESSFUL in the output and tuscany-das-rdb-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar is created under <local tuscany dir>/java/das/rdb/target directory.
         2.External resources are at times unavailable. It may be necessary to run "mvn" again at a later time.
         3.If you are taking time to reply to firewall prompts, this can cause some requests to time out. Set up the firewall to permit the action without prompting.

Dependency Jars


The DAS.RDB project has a dependency on SDO and requires the following SDO runtime jars to build

    *  sdo-api-r2.0.1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - SDO 2.0 Interfaces
    *  tuscany-sdo-impl-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - SDO 2.0 implementation

The SDO.IMPL project have dependencies on the following EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework - www.eclipse.org/emf) runtime jars to build:

    *  emf-common-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - some common framework utility and base classes
    *  emf-ecore-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - the EMF core runtime implementation classes (the Ecore metamodel)
    *  emf-ecore-change-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - the EMF change recorder and framework
    *  emf-ecore-xmi-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - EMF's default XML (and XMI) serializer and loader
    *  xsd-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - the XML Schema model
