   DAS Java M2 is a superset of previous DAS Java M1 release.
   Anything in M1 is also in M2, but M2 contains features and bugfixes not present in M1 release.

Compatibility Concerns

   - We have removed support for named parameters and previous DAS configuration files will have to be updated as needed.
